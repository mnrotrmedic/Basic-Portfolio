        <p>
                My name is Matt. Smiles. I am a Manager for
                Life Link III, an air ambulance company based
                in Minneapolis, MN. I manage three bases that
                make up the 'West Region'; Alexandria, Brainerd
                & Willmar, MN. I've been a paramedic for about ten
                years and a manager for the last two years.
            <br>
                I am a father of three; Adrian, William & Anna.
                Depending on their mood, I will refer to them as 
                either my three little angels or my three little
                animals. My wife Laura and I live with William & 
                Anna in Sartell, MN. Adrian lives with his mother
                in a Twin Cities suburb.
            <br>
                I'm currenly enrolled in a coding 'bootcamp' 
                with the goal of "learning how to learn" coding.
                With this program I want to develop a bedrock framework
                to understand how coding languages work and use this
                to learn more and dig much deeper into
                coding.
