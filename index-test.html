        <p>
            My name is Matt. Smiles. I am a Manager for
            Life Link III, an air ambulance company based
            in Minneapolis, MN. I manage three bases that
            make up the 'West Region'; Alexandria, Brainerd
            & Willmar, MN. I've been a paramedic for about ten
            years and a manager for the last two years.
            <br>
            I am a father of three; Adrian, William & Anna.
            Depending on their mood, I will refer to them as
            either my three little angels or my three little
            animals. My wife Laura and I live with William &
            Anna in Sartell, MN. Adrian lives with his mother
            in a Twin Cities suburb.
            <br>
            I'm currenly enrolled in a coding 'bootcamp'
            with the goal of "learning how to learn" coding.
            With this program I want to develop a bedrock framework
            to understand how coding languages work and use this
            to learn more and dig much deeper into
            coding.
