                    My name is Matt. Smiles. I am a Manager for
                    Life Link III, an air ambulance company based
                    in Minneapolis, MN. I manage three bases that
                    make up the 'West Region'; Alexandria, Brainerd
                    & Willmar, MN. I've been a paramedic for about ten
                    years and a manager for the last two years.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am a father of three; Adrian, William & Anna.
                    Depending on their mood, I will refer to them as 
                    either my three little angels or my three little
                    animals. My wife Laura and I live with William & 
                    Anna in Sartell, MN. Adrian lives with his mother
                    in a Twin Cities suburb.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'm currenly enrolled in a coding 'bootcamp' 
                    with the goal of "learning how to learn" coding.
                    With this program I want to develop a bedrock framework
                    to understand how coding languages work and use this
                    to learn more and dig much deeper into
                    coding.
