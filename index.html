    <br> <!--About me-->

    <p>
        My name is Matt. Smiles. I am a Manager for
        Life Link III, an air ambulance company based
        in Minneapolis, MN. I manage three bases that
        make up the 'West Region'; Alexandria, Brainerd
        & Willmar, MN. I've been a paramedic for about ten
        years and a manager for about two years. The hardest
        thing about managing is giving up taking care of sick
        people.

        I am a father of three; Adrian, William & Anna.
        Depending on their mood, I will refer to them as 
        either my three little angels or my three little
        animals. My wife Laura and I live with William & 
        Anna in Sartell, MN. Adrian lives with his mother
        in a Twin Cities suburb.

        I'm currenly enrolled in a coding 'bootcamp' 
        with the goal of "learning how to learn" coding.
        With this program I want to develop a bedrock framework
        to understand how coding languages work and use this
        to learn more and dig much deeper into
        coding.
